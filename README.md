# Reinforcement Learning: Lunar Lander Model & Demo :rocket:

### :bulb: Description
The objective of this study is to deploy a Reinforcement Learning model which trains a toy rocket to accurrately land within a designated area of the lunar surface. The model demonstrates the power of RL by significantly outperforming a random agent. In addition, the trained lunar lander agent is showcased in a visual demo.
